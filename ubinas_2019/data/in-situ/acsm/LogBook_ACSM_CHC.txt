Q-ACSM 140-146

Chacaltaya station, Bolivia
The time in this logbook is writen in Local time

Instrument was adjusted to UTC time!!


19/02/2018

The instrument was taken from the box. The stainless steel inlet was bent 45 degrees and the critical orifice was
bent too. So, the critical orifice was replaced by a 130 um.
Pumps were started.




20/02/2018

Power break for 6 days.




26/02/2018

Pumps were started.




27/02/2018

DAQ was crashing every 10 min. So Phil, from ARI, updated the firaware remotely. Since then, DAQ has not crashed.

There was a short between the Filament and the Vaporizer, clearly, the filament was switching off itself everytime
the vaporizer was on.
So, the instrument was vented and, indeed, the ion cage was touching the vaporizer. Openning a slide screw we pull the vaporizer down and made sure no wires were touching.

Pumps were started.





28/02/2018

Flowrate calibration (critical orifice was in)
New calibratio values:

Y=2.2079 X - 0.58

Room temperature: ~20C

The critical orifice was cleaned. 
Inlet pressure=1.27 Torr


01/03/2018
Lens alignment with AN, 300 nm particles, ~85 #/cm3
OBS: The inlet + lens system looked visually miss-aligned, maybe because of the problem at the customs.
New position: Horiz= 8,43    Vertic=8,19


Critical orifice was cleaned.

17:47 - Start measurements with Magee dryer on and flow controller box at 2LPM (1.80 volts).

Pressure: 

Tuning: it improved the shoulder on the right side of n2.
Vaporizer Set V=5.7V
Heater Bias=89.60V
Ions Ref=97
Cathode=-70
Focus=-10.5
Field Axis=-15.0
Extraction=-114

SEM V=1675 V
Resolution=65

21:08 - replaced the flow controller box by the water CPC 3787. This model measures down to 5 nm, whilw the CPC 3772 (Tropos) measures down to 10 nm.
AB=230 nAmp

22:35 - changed the resolution to 50.
23:08 - the CPC was plugged straight to the main inlet, bypassing the dryer and the ACSM. No change. The water CPC continues measuring 50% less particles.
The ACSM was stopped.
23:15 - stop CPC measurements.
23:19 - start ACSM with dryer and flow controller box
23:30 - m/z calibration, new offset=+0.0005 and slope=1.0025


02/03/2018
9:00 Mass calibration.
The Calibration system was set up following the diagram from the Italian ACSM. The sillica dryer was replaced by the 
USP one, using sillica that was dryed the day before, and the nebulizer as well, because the yellow one didnt have a tube to go into the solution.
Since the water CPC was measuring very low concntrations compared to the Total butanol CPC, a butanol CPC was borrowed for the calibration, but the concentrations were still very low for the amount of NH4NO3 added to the solution. Therefore, the nebulizer was once again replaced by the yellow one borrowing the bottle tube from the USP nebulizer and the counts increased immediatly, so the problem might have been the low pressure from the USP nebulizer to the DMA.
After that, the calibrations were performed starting from ~900 particles/cc down to zero (water), and the resulting IE amps/loading slope is 2.17e-10.

14:15 Returned to ambient measurements.


07/03/2018 21:39
The SEMV was increased to 1725V.

08/03/2018

16:20 start ambient measurements
16:34 ACSM hard shut down. Power board it was connected to was shorted.
16:38 Power re-established. ACSM pumping down. Cant figure out how to use the control software.

11:40 critical orifice cleaned. Likely a lot of dust in the air that got it pretty clogged.
11:48 measurement back on.

2018-04-17 Liine
14:20 disconnecting the dryer to see if NO3 and org go up. We are thinking we might lose some
semi-volatile stuff in the dryer. I disconnected the dryer power cable too.
14:35 critical orifice cleaned. back to ambient measurement.

2018-04-19 Liine

15:00 critical orifice cleaned, inlet p went up to 1.2 torr, flow 2.25 ccs. PM2.5 cyclone flow checked.
It is ok.

16:25 changed vaporizer voltage back to a lower value. I am worried of the refractory stuff (neg spikes
in diff spectra).



2018-04-23, 14:24 - Samara

Inlet line was unplugged at 14:41
Inlet pressure was 1.05 torr

Because the Tee part is not at CHC, well start with the organic standards.

19:12 - start sampling ambient air using the Magee Dryer.


24-04-2018 14:18
The calibrations for AN, previous to this were all wrong because the size was different due to altitude, so the size used during calibration was wrong,
SEMV was 1830 V by mistake. It was changed back to 1900V and saved again.
Measurements were stopped.

The critical orifice was replaced by  120um, however, the inlet pressure is not achieving the 1.2 torr anymore, only 1.07 torr.

ACSM PC remained off. ACSM turned off as instructed by Marcos Andrade

 
2018-08-30 17:50 Samara

SEMV was reduced to 1880V because it was too high AB.

2018-09-26 Valeria, Junior
17:43 Servo successfully replaced. Inlet valve fixed. Critical orifice cleaned. Inlet P: 1.168 torr
It looks lke the problem was related to a blown fuse on the board. It was replaced to 1.5A.
M/z cal adjust, new slope=1.0053 and offset=0

ACSM working fine, so much sulfate these days

2018-10-18 Fher 
14:30UTC start zero test
18:55 zero test ended

the dryer is working fine!!!!! the issue was related to the power of the vaccum pump. The one that Valeria setup is not strong enough to generated an adequate vaccump pressure in the dryer.
So, I have changed the pump to a stronger one then I adjusted the vaccum meter to -0.25bar which produce a counterflow of 4.9 lpm which is in a good compromise between sample flow-counterflow-vaccum pressure.
air pressure = 1.171 torr --> great
